## About Aspectran

Aspectran is a versatile and lightweight framework for Java, designed to simplify the development of a wide range of applicationsâ€”from web and standalone applications to shell and daemon services. It is built on the principles of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and Inversion of Control (IoC), providing a clear and modular structure for your projects.

At its core, Aspectran helps you separate concerns, manage dependencies, and configure your application in a flexible and consistent manner. Whether you are building a simple REST API or a complex, enterprise-level system, Aspectran provides the tools you need to get the job done efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build your application from reusable, loosely-coupled components (beans).
- **Powerful AOP Support**: Easily implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configure your application using XML or the intuitive APON (Aspectran Parameter Object Notation) format.
- **Multiple Execution Environments**: Run your application as a web service, a command-line tool, a daemon, or embedded within another Java application.
- **Extensible and Modular**: Easily extend the framework with custom modules and integrations.
